Simple-to-use application for training musical hearing. Targeted specifically to the musicians (from the start of the musical education until retirement.<br/>


## About

With this application, you can improve your musical hearing in a fun and interactive way.
You can choose different modes of how intervals, chords, and tones will be playing and how they are displayed.

Exercise hearing recognition in the main, random mode. When you are ready, you can test your hearing abilities in the quiz. The quiz consists of three modes: easy, medium, and hard. In the easy mode, one interval, chord, or tone is played, and one will be displayed. You will need to select whether they are the same. The medium mode will offer four intervals, chords, or tones. You need to select the one that has been played. In the hard mode, you will have to select exactly what is played.

We also offer the ability to train perfect pitch. If you choose to listen to the tones in the settings, you will need to recognize the tone in a given octave. If this is too big a challenge, you can also choose to listen to an octave. In that case, you will know in the quiz what tone has been played, but you will need to determine in which octave that tone is. If you select both modes you will need to know exactly which tone is being played and in what octave. This way, you can practice and achieve absolute hearing.

 - Select those intervals and chords you want to listen to
 - Choose how intervals and chords will play:
	1) Ascending
